# What is META?

MetaDAO is governed by META, whose mint is METADDFL6wWMWEoKTFJwcThTbUmtarRJZjRpzUvkxhr.

On November 15th 2023, 10,000 META was [airdropped to 60 wallets](https://blog.metadao.fi/the-meta-dao-decentralizes-d2d01dd5aa45), with the remaining 990,000 META being sent to MetaDAO's treasury.&#x20;

**All META from the treasury has entered the circulating supply through market-approved governance proposals.**

In March 2024, a group of community members created a proposal to [burn 979,000 META from the treasury](https://futarchy.metadao.fi/metadao/proposals/ELwCkHt1U9VBpUFJ7qGoVMatEwLSr1HYj9q9t8JQ1NcU). That proposal passed, capping the supply of the current mint to 21,000 META. MetaDAO may choose to migrate to a new token mint which gives the DAO the ability to mint new tokens.
