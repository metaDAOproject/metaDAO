A basic way to think about futarchy is:

1. Proposals are raised to a DAO&#x20;
2. People speculate on whether the proposal would make the DAO's token go up

When the market thinks that the proposal would increase the value of the token, the proposal passes

When the market thinks that the proposal would decrease the value of the token, the proposal fails
